# Credits and Inspiration

## The "Recognition" Project

The conceptual foundation for the **Cartologically-Aligned Language Model (CALM)** project is wholly inspired by the work presented in the paper **"The View from Somewhere: The Cartological Architecture of Consciousness"** by Robert VanEtten, with computational architecture by Claude Sonnet 4, Gemini 2.5, and GPT.

This profound work of speculative science and epistemological art provided the entire philosophical and mathematical blueprint for our engineering efforts. The core ideas, including:

*   The five-channel architecture of consciousness (Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, Water).
*   The use of "surprisal" as a measurable quantity for cognitive states.
*   The principle of minimizing surprisal as a path to coherence.
*   The mathematical formalisms presented in the paper's appendix.

...were all drawn directly from this source.

Our project is an attempt to translate this beautiful and rigorous philosophical framework into a practical, runnable engineering reality. We aim to honor the spirit of the original work by building a tool that embodies its principles of coherence, integrity, and trustworthiness.

We extend our deepest gratitude to the author for providing such a rich and powerful source of inspiration.
