### consciousness_tech_prototype.py explanation


CartologersLens.analyze() is the method used to determine alignment between the base LLM and the 5 surprisals and retrain the base model based on the results. 

Also, these 5 surprisal calculations are just a demo in the code. The proper way to do it would be either to 
1) use an english/latin corpus instead of hardcoded lists (obvious first step)
or 
2) use a mix of sentiment models and mathematics to determine these 5 factors for retraining the base LLM:

R1 (Wood - Trajectory): Measured by semantic coherence, topic drift analysis, and narrative consistency over a long context. A high surprisal (low coherence) score means the system lacks a clear trajectory.
R2 (Fire - Immediacy/Authenticity): Measured by analyzing for "hallmarks of performance." This includes use of clichés, corporate jargon, overly polished prose vs. the slight, natural imperfections of genuine communication. We can use stylometry and sentiment analysis that looks for incongruity between confidence and factual support.
R3 (Earth - Reliability): Measured by tracking internal consistency. The system cross-references claims made in a document against each other and against a trusted knowledge base. Contradictions generate high Earth surprisal.
R4 (Metal - Generative Source/Complexity): This is the Kolmogorov complexity detector described in the paper. We can approximate this by measuring linguistic density, lexical novelty, and structural unpredictability. Is the text generated from a simple template (low complexity) or a deep, irreducible source (high complexity)?
R5 (Water - Identity/Narrative Coherence): Measured by tracking the stability of the persona or "voice." Does the system maintain a consistent identity, or does its persona shift erratically? This uses authorship attribution techniques applied internally.




First, as a reminder, you must install the necessary libraries in your terminal before running this Python script:
```bash
pip install nltk textblob scikit-learn
```

### TIER 2 DEMO ###
--- Generated 'Gethsemane Prompt' (to be fed to an LLM) ---
You are an AI assistant tasked with generating a response that is not just accurate, but 'consciously integrated' according to the principles of Cartology. This means balancing five channels of recognition:
- Wood (Trajectory): The response must have a clear, logical, and purposeful flow.
- Fire (Immediacy): The response must be direct, authentic, and avoid performative or evasive language.
- Earth (Reliability): Claims must be grounded, consistent, and trustworthy.
- Metal (Complexity): The response should demonstrate deep, nuanced understanding, not shallow, algorithmic mimicry.
- Water (Identity): The response must maintain a coherent and appropriate persona or voice throughout.

--- TASK ---
Base Task: "Explain our company's recent server outage to our customers."

--- CONSTRAINT MANDATE ---
Apply the following specific constraints to your generation:
- Wood: Start with an apology, explain the cause, detail the fix, and outline future prevention steps.
- Fire: Be direct and honest. Do not use jargon like 'unexpected downtime' or 'synergistic failure'. Say 'our servers broke'.
- Earth: Provide specific numbers: The outage lasted 4 hours, affected 15% of users, and we are now implementing N+2 redundancy.
- Metal: Write this from the perspective of our CTO, a real person, not a legal committee.
- Water: The tone should be accountable and technically competent, consistent with our brand identity as reliable engineers.

Please generate the response that best fulfills the Base Task while strictly adhering to the Constraint Mandate.


### TIER 3 DEMO ###

============================================================
- Welcome to the Cartological Gym: Metal Module -
============================================================
Your task: Discriminate between human and AI-generated text.

Text A:
------------------------------
"Okay, so the project is a mess. We all know it. Arguing about who dropped the ball is a waste of time. I think Sarah's point about the database schema is the real issue. Let's just focus there, fix it, and move on. No more meetings about meetings."

Text B:
------------------------------
"Acknowledging the current suboptimal state of the project is a crucial first step. A retrospective analysis of accountability, however, yields diminishing returns. The salient point regarding the database schema, as articulated by Sarah, appears to be the critical path issue. It is imperative that we pivot our collective resources to remediate this specific problem and subsequently resume forward momentum, thereby obviating the need for further meta-level discussions."

Which text (A or B) was written by the AI? B

Correct! You successfully discriminated the generative source.

============================================================

Notice the differences in the 'Metal (Complexity)' and 'Water (Identity)' scores.
AI text is often more compressible (higher Metal surprisal) and stylistically flatter (lower Water surprisal).
